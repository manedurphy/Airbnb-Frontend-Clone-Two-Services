# Airbnb Clone

This is an Airbnb clone that I worked on with two software engineers for learning and improving front end skills. The resources required to run this project have been taken down and can no longer be run locally. A link to a showcase of my two services are linked below.


I do NOT own the static assets (the AirBnb logo). The photos were gathered from Unsplash.

## Technologies Used
1. ReactJS/Redux
2. Node
3. MySQL
4. Redis
5. Styled-Components
6. EC2
7. S3 bucket

I had a great time with this project and feel very comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JS. I can safely say that I prefer backend techonlogies, but this was fun and I can appreciate the skillset of frontend developers.
